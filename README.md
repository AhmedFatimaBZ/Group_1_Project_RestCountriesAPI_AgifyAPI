# GROUP 1 PROJECT - Rest API and Agify API

# Overview of the project
**Agify API:**  How do you tell the age of someone from their name? Well, here is a fun little API that you can use. Agify is used for predicting the age of a person given their name. It is free to use for up to 1000 requests/day. Agify API was used to predict the ages of Group 1 members.

**Rest Countries:** Thinking about building an application where you will need data about different countries of the world? Here is the API you will need. Supported by donations, this free API provides information about the countryâ€™s currency, capital, region, language, etc. Rest Countries was used to suggest Vacation spots in different countries.

## How to run the code 
1. **Clone the repository** - git clone https://github.com/KateRasheed/Group_1_Project_RestCountriesAPI_AgifyAPI.git
2. **Change Directory in to the file** - cd Group_1_Project_RestCountriesAPI_AgifyAPI
3. **Run the program** - python Rest_Age.py
4. **Follow the prompt to enter desired country**
   




# Agify Age Prediction
This Python script uses the Agify API to predict the ages for a list of names and saves the results to a text file. Follow the steps below to run the code.
 
1. **Python:** Ensure that you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Requests Library:** Install the `requests` library, which is used for making HTTP requests.
3. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
4.  Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script.
5. Run the script using the following command: python Rest_Age.py
6. The script will make requests to the Agify API for each name in the list and print the results to the terminal. The results will be saved to a text file named 'group_members_age_prediction.txt.'
7. If you want to predict ages for a different set of names, modify the 'name_to_predict' list in the script. Add or remove names based on your preferences.
